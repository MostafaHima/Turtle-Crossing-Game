# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple game created using Python's `turtle` graphics module. In this game, the player controls a turtle that must navigate upwards to reach the finish line while avoiding obstacles (moving cars). The player's score increases each time they reach the finish line, and the game ends when the player collides with a car.

## Game Overview

- **Player:** A turtle that can move upward when the "Up" arrow key is pressed.
- **Objective:** Reach the finish line without colliding with any of the moving cars.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the player collides with a car.

## Features

- Moving cars with random colors and speeds.
- Increasing difficulty as the player reaches the finish line.
- A scoreboard displaying the current level/score.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `main.py` to start the game.
2. Use the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle upwards.
3. Avoid the moving cars while trying to reach the finish line.
4. Your score (level) increases each time you cross the finish line.
5. The game ends when the turtle collides with a car.
